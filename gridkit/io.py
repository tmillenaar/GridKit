    Parameters
    ----------
    path: str, file object, PathLike object, FilePath, or MemoryFile
        A filename or URL, a file object opened in binary ('rb') mode, a
        Path object, or one of the rasterio classes that provides the
        dataset-opening interface.
    bounds: Tuple(float, float, float, float)
        The bounding box of the data to read in (min-x, min-y, max-x, max-y). Can be used to read a smaller
        section of the dataset. If the bounds are larger than the raster bounds,
        the full raster will be read.
    bounds_crs: CRS
        The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) that matches the supplied `bounds` argument.
        The `bounds` are then converted to the CRS that matches the dataset before reading
        the tile. This allows for reading a section of the dataset defined in any CRS,
        unrelated to the CRS of the dataset.

        .. Note ::

            The dataset will be read in the CRS corresponding to the data file,
            not the bounds_crs.

    border_buffer: float
        Enlarge the supplied `bounds` with the specified border_radius.
        A negative border_radius can be supplied to decrease the bounds.
        The unit of the border_radius is that of bounds_crs, or that of the
        dataset CRS if bounds_crs is not supplied.
    band: int
        The index of the band to read. Default: 1.
        Note that raster bands start at 1, so if you
        want to read the first band, supply band=1, not band=0.

    Returns
    -------
    class:`.DataTile`
        A data tile with spatial properties based on the input raster
