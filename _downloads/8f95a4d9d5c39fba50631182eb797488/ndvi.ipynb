        "\n# NDVI\n\nOperation using two raster bands\n\nIn this example we read two Sentinel 2 raster bands and combine them to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).\nSince these bands are already from the same Sentinel 2 acquisition, they are already 'aligned'.\nThis means none of the bands have to be resampled before we combine them.\n\n.. tip ::\n    \n    If this example matches your use case, you may also be interested in the packages Rasterio or Rioxarray.\n    This example is created to get the reader familiar with the synax of GridKit and to highlight some of the intricacies when working with this package.\n    \nAlso, a numpy warning is raised because we devide by zero for some cells.\nThese turn into NaN-values.\nThis is remedied in the script by replacing each NaN-value with 0 afterwards.\n"
