Warning ::\n\n   Be mindful of the projection of your dataset.\n   This dataset is in ETRS89, which is defined in degrees, which can introduce a bias.\n   Grids defined in degrees generally do not have consistent spacing in x and y direction,\n   meaning that one degree north is not the same distance as one degree south.\n   It is generally recommended to work with grids defined in a local CRS that is not\n   defined in degrees but either meters or feet.\n\n\n## Resampling onto the a grid\n\nNow we have read the DEM, we can define a new grid and resample onto it\nLet's define a coarser grid, effectively downsampling the data.\nThe reason for this is that we can better compare grids if we can actually distinguish the cells.\nLet's define a rectangular grid with a cell size of 10x10 degrees.\nI am calling it rectdem for later on I will define hexagonal ones as well.\nTo make sure it worked we can print out the cellsize after resampling\n\n"
