Tip ::\n\n   You may have noticed that area's containing NaNs get exaggerated after filtering.\n   Scipy's implementation of ``gaussian_filter`` does not take NaNs into account.\n   This means each pixel where the kernal contains a NaN will become NaN too.\n   If this is a problem for your dataset,\n   have a look at [astropy's implementation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/convolution/).\n\n..\n\n\n## Nodata values\n\nFor each grid, the nodata value of that grid is also taken into account.\nThis means that values outside of the original extent of each respective data grid are not considered in the calculation.\nIf the data grids have different nodata_values, this still works, for each grid's nodata_value is considered separately.\nIn that scenario the resulting product will have the nodata_value of the first grid.\n\n"
