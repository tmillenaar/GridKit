A cell is supplied to the \"downslope_path\" function\n 2. The neighbouring cells are obtained\n 3. These cells are added to a list containing all neighbours along the path so far\n 4. The neighbour along the path so far with the lowest elevation is added to the path, at which point we start again at 1.\n\nThe loop stops when NaNs are encountered, which happens when the border of the DEM crop is reached.\nThis is of course assuming there are no nodata_values in the DEM.\n\nFirst let's import the dependencies and read in the DEM.\n"
