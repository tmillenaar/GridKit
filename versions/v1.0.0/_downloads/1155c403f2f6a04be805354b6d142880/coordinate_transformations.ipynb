        "\n# Coordinate transformations\n\n\nTransform a grid from one CRS to another\n\n## Introduction\nA Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is a means of representing a 3D surface (usually of Earth) onto a 2D map. There are many Coordinate Reference Systems, all with their own advantages and discrepencies. There is no one CRS to\nrule them all, there are only tradeoffs. That said, it is generally recommended to use a locally defined CRS when possible.\n\n.. Note ::\n    In gridkit, a CRS is optional. If you represent, say,  a generic image as a grid there is no need for a CRS. By default, the CRS property on a grid is None. It can either be supplied when the grid is initiated or by setting the propery on the grid after creation, e.g. ``grid.crs = 4326``.\n\n## Warped grids\nGrids always have straight lines in the CRS they are defined in.\nWhen a straigt line is transformed to a different CRS, it often gets warped.\nTo demonstrate this, let's create a grid in WGS84 (epsg code 4326) and transform the coordinates of each cell to CRS UTM N29 (epsg code 32629).\n"
