Warning ::\n\n   Be mindful of the projection of your dataset.\n   This dataset is in ETRS89, which is defined in degrees, which can introduce a bias.\n   Grids defined in degrees generally do not have consistent spacing in x and y direction,\n   meaning that one degree north is not the same distance as one degree south.\n   It is generally recommended to work with grids defined in a local CRS that is not\n   defined in degrees but either meters or feet.\n\n\n## Resampling onto the a grid\n\nNow we have read the DEM, we can define a new grid and resample onto it\nLet's define a coarser grid, effectively downsampling the data.\nThe reason for this is that we can better compare grids if we can actually distinguish the cells.\nLet's define a rectangular grid with a cell size of 10x10 degrees.\nI am calling it rectdem for later on I will define hexagonal ones as well.\nTo make sure it worked we can print out the cellsize after resampling\n\n"

        "When observing these plots it is obvious that one of them has something weird going on at the edge of the tile.\nTriangluar and hexagonal grids both have one of the axes that is irregular. Sometimes it works out such that\nan irregular row or column has some cells inside the tile and some outside. In such a case we can have nodata values\nat the edges. The original dem file has the nodata value set to 0. The nodata value is inherited when resampling.\nWe see these 0 values here at the edges. Matplotlib recognizes NaN values as nodata but just shows 0 values,\nas it should. Of course this not only affects the sides of the plot but also changes the range of the colormap.\nFor visualization we can set the nodata_value of our dems to NaN, which will replace all\noccurences of a nodata value in our tile with the new nodata value.\n\n.. Note ::\n\n    The edges can also contain nodata_values if the interpolation method looks at neighboring cells,\n    such as with bilinear resampling. If one of the neighbours of a cell is outside of the tile,\n    the interpolation result will also be a nodata_value, even if the cell itself is inside of the tile.\n\n..\n\n\n"
