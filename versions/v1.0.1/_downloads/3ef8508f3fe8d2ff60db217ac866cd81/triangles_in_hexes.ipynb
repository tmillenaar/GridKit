        "\n\n# Triangles in hexagons\n\nAligning different types of grids\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this example a triangle and a hexagon grid are defined in such a way\nthat they perfectly line up. A hexagon can be neatly divided into six triangles.\n\n.. Tip ::\n\n    The process in this example has been greatly simplified with the introduction\n    of :meth:`.HexGrid.subdivide` in v0.12.0.\n    This example shows the more cumbersome approach, but I will leave this example\n    up for now for educational purposes, for it shows how to manipulate cell size\n    and offsets to position the grid the way you want.\n\n..\n\nFor the two grids to visually align, two things will need to match:\n - the length of the edge connecting two vertices needs to be the same\n - they need an origin point that lines them up properly\n\nWhen initializing a grid in GridKit, the size specified by the user reflects the\ndistance between the centroids of two neighboring cells (dx).\nFor the hexagonal grid this will be a different value than for the triangle grid.\nThe triangle grid is easiest. The side length is `2*dx`.\nLet's say we want side lengths of 1, we specify a size for the triangle grid of 0.5.\nFor the hexagonal grid this is less intuitive, it works out\nto be three over the square root of three: `3 / sqrt(3)`.\nAt least this is the case if we use a 'flat' orientation for our hexagonal grid,\nwhich we will need to do in order for the grids to overlap.\nIf this is not obvious, I encourage you to do this exercise with a 'pointy' hexagonal grid.\nIt will be obvious from the plot.\n\nLet's first plot some cells of these two grids and compare them.\nFrom there we can figure out how to shift the grids in order to align them.\n"

Our grids are centered around the origin.\nNow we can play with the interaction between these grids.\nWe can for example figure out what triangles belong to what hexagon.\nThe simplest way to do this is to get the centroids of the triangles\nand call cell_at_point on the hexagon grid using these centroids.\nWe can even give every triangle in the top-left of a hexagon the same color for example.\nBecause of the way we ordered the cell-ids, we know that\nthe first triangle will be in the top left of the hexagon.\nIf you obtained the cell id's in a different manner,\nyou can sort them to make sure this is the case.\nYou can use numpy for this, like ``numpy.sort(tri_ids.ravel())`` for example.\n\nFirst let's find all the hex_ids.\nWe can then assign each hex id a different value.\nThen we plot the triangles using these values and expect the hexagon\ngrid to be reflected in the colors\n\n\n"
