        "\n\n# Tiled aggregation from points with Dask\n\nGroup points into grid cells in a tiled manner, using Dask.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn example `aggregate.py <example aggregate>` an approach is demonstrated where points are grouped in cells and averaged per cell.\nThis example does the same, but in a tiled manner.\nDask is used for the groupby opertaion instead of Pandas.\nThe main difference is that Dask divides the data into chunks that can be processed independently.\nThis approach is beneficial if data does not comfortably fit into memory.\nA second reason to use this approach is the ability to process different chunks concurrently, which can provide a significant speedup.\n\n.. Note ::\n\n    Even though parallel processing using Dask can speed up the script, \n    for a small case like this the overhead is larger than the benefit obtained by parallelizing the operation.\n\n..\n\nFor a description of the approach used, please refer to `aggregate.py <example aggregate>`.\nIn this example only the differences between the approaches will be highlighted.\n\n.. Note ::\n\n    Dask uses the terms 'chunks', 'blocks' and 'partitions'.\n    While there are some nuances, in this example these terms will be used interchangably.\n    I will try to stick with 'chunks' where I can since this is the general term, \n    though you will find references to 'map_blocks()' for Arrays and 'map_partitions()' for DataFrames.\n\n## Generate input data\n\nLet's start by generating some points.\nThe data will be a set of points scattered around a circle to create \na dougnut-like shape.\nI will first generate the points and the turn them into a Dask Array\nusing ``dask.array.from_dask``.\nIn a scenario where Dask is used because the data is large and memory is limited,\nyou will likely obtain your dask array in a way that\ndoes not involve first loading the whole array into memory like I do here.\nI will print ``npartitions`` to show the number of chunks the array is divided in\n(spoiler, it will be 2000/500 = 4).\n"
